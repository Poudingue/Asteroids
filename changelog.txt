Bugs :
  -modulos af asteroids do not appear irregular as they should
  -Still the angle.

Bugs :
  -Still the angle

V1.1 :
Features :
  -Death disables controls.
  -Once dead everything is slow-motion, the ship is spinning out of control shooting everywhere
  -New way to visualise health
  -Game speed changes based on events. (Explosions and asteroid destruction create a slow-motion effect)
  -Changed health calculation for asteroids, adding a fixed amount to what is calculated based on mass. Allows little asteroids to be more resistant.
  -5 fragments (1 more !) spawn on asteroid death
  -More diversity in size spawn for asteroid
  -Lower physical resistance for asteroids
  -Asteroids now break into 5 fragments
  -Higher physical resistance for the ship
  -Higher acceleration for the ship

  -Now unspawned objects and fragments also create fragments on death
  -Fragments now have a slightly different exposition from their parents to better differentiate
  -More tweaks than I can remember !
Bugs :
  -Still the angle
  -Can't quit when dead
  -Health isn't rendered properly on modulos of objects
  -Numbers supposed to indicate perfs are displayed on projectiles
  -Projectiles render isn't scaled properly. Probably due to the dithering artificially increasing size of objects. (Nope, it was because you change the width of the line, not the radius. I fixed it for you, past me.)
  -Destroyed unspawned asteroids will spawn fragments on both sides of screen. Just need to create an unspawned_fragments list
  -Performance drop when there is a lot going on on weak pcs.
   Need to optimise and make some effect toggleable.
