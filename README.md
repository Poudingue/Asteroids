## Synopsis

This project is based on an assignement, which goal was to imitate as closely as possible the classic arcade game Asteroids.

Even though i used oCaml, a language i'm not really a big fan of, it worked out pretty good. I know the code is pretty clunky and repetitive sometimes, with some ugly workarounds, but it works !



## Compilation and Launch

You can compile this game using the command line :

ocamlc -o asteroids unix.cma graphics.cma asteroids.ml

Run it with ./asteroids
